<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>Here you can make overview about how shfs works.</p>

<h2>The source tree</h2>

<p>Shfs sources are split across few directories. The <tt>shfs/Linux-2.x</tt>
directory contains kernel module code for the specified kernel version, while shfsmount/ directory
is where user-space utilities live (shfsmount, the perl/shell server core is here too).</p>

<h2>Where the code came from</h2>

<p>Since writing new filesystem module from the scratch is not very funny thing, shfs
was partially based on Florin Malita's <a href="http://ftpfs.sourceforge.net/">ftpfs</a>.
with some bugs fixed (locking, memory leaks, handling of date). As the time flows, the code
from ftpfs began to vanish and now there is hardly any there. I have assimilated some portions
of smbfs(ncpfs) code (mainly directory caching code through page cache) from the main Linux
kernel tree.

<h2>Caches</h2>

<p>Sending shell command to the remote host on every request from the kernel VFS layer
is not a wise idea, because of high load it generates on both sides of ssh channel.
Much better way is to use the caches for some operations, such as reading directories,
reading and writing files, etc.

<h3>Read-write cache</h3>
(<a href="../../shfs/Linux-2.6/fcache.c">fcache.c</a>)
<ul>
<li>on file open, n pages are allocated as simple read-write buffer
<li>file-offset and size are associated with the buffer
<li>entire buffer is either clean (for read only) or dirty (data not yet written)
<li>on read request, an attempt to read full buffer is performed (dirty data are flushed)
<li>subsequent requests read data from this buffer (hit)
<li>on write request, if there is enough space in the buffer, data are written to the buffer
<li>if buffer is full or file is closed, the entire buffer is is send to the remote peer
</ul>

<p>This makes great performance improvement, since calling <tt>dd</tt> (= storing
data on the remote side) for each page generate quite high system load.
Using read-write cache, <tt>dd</tt> is only called every on nth request.
You can switch this cache off using "nocache" option while mounting the filesystem.

<h3>Directory cache</h3>
(<a href="../../shfs/Linux-2.6/dcache.c">dcache.c</a>)
<ul>
<li>this cache is taken almost intact from smbfs/ncpfs, it uses plain dentry cache and
page cache to prevent rm -rf from complaining
<li>the time-to-live of the dentry is 30 seconds by default, could be changed in
the mount-time (ttl option).
</ul>

<h3>Readline cache</h3>
(<a href="../../shfs/Linux-2.6/proc.c">proc.c</a>, function <tt>sock_readln</tt>)
<p>Lines are read all at once instead of char-by-char. This speeds up directory lookup.</p>

<h2>How it all works together</h2>

<p><a href="images/schema.png">Figure</a> illustrates: When user calls shfsmount (or mount -t shfs) command in
order to mount remote share, basic checks are done, process is forked and user
command (ssh in most cases) is executed. This command has stdin/stdout
redirected so it can be used for the connection by shfsmount. After connection is established,
shfsmount initializes remote side and transfers &quot;server&quot; code to the remote side.</p>

<p>Although shfs is <strong>sh</strong>ell <strong>f</strong>ile<strong>s</strong>ystem,
there are two different server code available: shell and perl. Both
have the same basic functionality although perl code is faster and more robust.
Every code type has its <em>test</em> phase which does all necessary checks (for
perl this would be perl version, available modules, etc.).</p>

<p>Then, shfsmount calls mount syscall and passes the file descriptor (of ssh stdin/stdout) to the kernel
module. Shfsmount could exit or wait for ssh to die and restart the connection again (while in persistent mode).</p>
