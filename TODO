TODO for shfs:

* rewrite stack allocations -> kmalloc
* sftp server code support
* autoconf
* show_options (cosmetic change)
* string uid unification (+ /proc interface)

KNOWN BUGS for shfs:

* Date of remote file/dir is (sometimes) not shown correctly (+- 1 day). 
  This is because of POSIX "show time for files changed in last six 
  months only" behaviour.

* "stable" option is not working on OSF1. Don't know how to force ls -L to
  show what GNU ls does.

BUGS:
`cat file.txt` ->
	file_read: permission denied
`rmdir TEST_FOLDER` ->
	rmdir: failed to remove `TEST_FOLDER': Device or resource busy

`ls` hangs unless we `ls` from any other directory in the mount
	point after deleting a file in that dir
